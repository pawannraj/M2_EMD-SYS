Description of components:
1.	Arduino uno:
	The Arduino Uno is an open source microcontroller board based on the microchip Atmega328p microcontroller
	The board is equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards (shields) and other circuits.
		The board has 14 Digital pins, 6 Analog pins, and programmable with the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) via a type B USB cable.
		It can be powered by the USB cable or by an external 9-volt battery though it accepts voltages between 7 and 20 volts.
